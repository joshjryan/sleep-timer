# sleep-timer
A poor man's sleep timer for Jellyfin

This is just a small side-project, with a lot of room for improvement.  Feel free to submit Pull Requests.

## Summary
Becasue most Jellyfin clients do not have a "Still Watching?" feature, I created a work-around.  This app leverages events from the official Jellyfin Webhook Plugin to count the number of episodes that any user has played on a specific device.  If more than 3 episodes have been played with less than one hour between start times, this will automatically stop playback of the fourth one.

## Requirements
1. Start the docker container
2. Install the [Jellyfin Webhook Plugin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-webhook)
3. Add a generic destination, with a Webhook URL of `http://{docker-address}:5553/webhook`
4. Choose the "Playback Start" Notification Type, choose the users who will use this sleep timer, and click the "Send All Properties (ignores template)" checkbox
